## Built With

* Python (3.8.2) : Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
* Django  is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural pattern.[7][8] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF).
* Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.
